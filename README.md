#This can represent the value of 80 moduled by 8 which is being added by 9 in parantheses which is also being subtracted by 7.
80%(8+9)-7

#This can represent 10 is greater than 7.
10 > 7

#This can represent 20 is smaller than something that equaals 20.
20 <= 20

#This can represent 20 and a number being equal to 30 and 10 equals to 7.
20 != 30 and 10 == 7

#This can represent 100 greater than the adddition of 98 plus 2 or 7 moduled by 2 which equals to 1.
100 > 98+2 or 7%2 == 1
