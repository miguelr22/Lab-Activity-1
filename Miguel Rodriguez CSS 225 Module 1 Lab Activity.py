#Worth 10 points each:

#This line evaluates to 4 because adding 2 and 2 gives you 4.
2+2

#This line evaluates to 3 because dividing 12 and 4 gives you 3.
12/4

#This lines evaluates to 0 because 8 moduled by 2 gives you 9.
8%2

#This lines evaluates to 696 because multiplying 100 by 7 gives you 700 and subtracting that by 6 gives you 696.
100*7-4

#This lines evaluates to 300 because multiplying 100 by the parentheses 7 and 4 gives you 300.
100*(7-4)

#This lines evaluates to 6.6 because 80 moduled by the parentheses 8 and 9 gives you 13.6 and subtracting that by 7 gives you 6.6.
80%(8+9)-7

#This line evaluates to true because 10 is greater than 7.
10 > 7

#This lines evaluates to false because 20 is greater than not equal to 20.
20 <= 20

#This line evaluates to 10 because 20 adding 10 is 30 and 10 is not equal to 7.  
20 != 30 and 10 == 7

#This line evaluates to equal because 100 is equal to 100 and 7 moduled by 2 gives you 100 and that equals to 1.
100 > 98+2 or 7%2 == 1

#BONUS: Modify this code to display the result of each line to the user through the console when this file is run
#       (there are several ways to do this).
